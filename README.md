Cross-Department Use Cases & Basic Prompting Concepts
AI prompting can enhance workflows in various departments:

HR:

Use Cases: Automating candidate screening, drafting HR policy Q&A, creating onboarding processes.
Impact: Saves time, standardizes information.


Development:

Use Cases: Code generation, debugging, refactoring, project documentation.
Impact: Accelerates development cycles, reduces repetitive tasks.


Other Departments:

Sales: Pros & cons of CRM tools, personalized outreach.
Marketing: Campaign ideation, refining brand messaging.
DevOps/IT: CI/CD setups, Dockerfiles, server logs analysis.
Data/Analytics: Data cleaning, SQL optimization.


Basic Prompting Concepts:

Clarity: Ask direct, unambiguous questions (e.g., “Provide three key metrics to measure HR onboarding process success”).
Context: Include background details (e.g., “Assume an HR department of 500 employees across two global offices”).
Constraints: Specify format or limits (e.g., “Respond in under 150 words using bullet points”).
Iteration: Refine with follow-up prompts (e.g., “Focus only on compliance requirements now”).



Example: HR Candidate Screening

Goal: Automate candidate screening questions.
Prompt Flow:
User: “Automate candidate screening for a software developer position. Ask clarifying questions first.”
AI: Clarifies technical skills, experience level, cultural fit, and number of questions.
User: Specifies mid-level Java developer with cloud experience, focusing on problem-solving and communication (5 questions).
AI: Delivers tailored questions; user may request additional questions (e.g., REST API best practices).



Example: Development Code Generation

Goal: Create a Python function to sort dictionaries by timestamp.
Prompt Flow:
User: “Create a Python function to sort dictionaries by ‘timestamp.’ Ask about performance and error handling.”
AI: Clarifies list size, missing timestamps, sorting library, and return type.
User: Specifies 100,000 records, default missing timestamps to current time, use built-in sorting, return new list.
AI: Provides function with docstrings and example usage.



Maintaining a Central "Project Doc" (Developer Focus)
A “Project Doc” is a living document (e.g., Confluence, Google Doc, or wiki) storing critical project details and AI prompt guidelines.

Benefits:

Ensures code consistency.
Speeds up onboarding for new developers.
Reduces guesswork with centralized constraints.
Enhances collaboration and transparency.


Key Components:

Feature Requirements & Goals: Technical user stories, acceptance criteria (e.g., “Unit test coverage ≥ 80%”).
Project Structures & Constraints: Directory layout, technical constraints, security requirements.
Global Instructions & Coding Standards: Frameworks, style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8), security best practices.
Prompt Templates & Examples: Code generation, debugging, and refactoring prompts.


Sample Layout:

Title & Intro: “Microservices Migration – Dev Master Doc.”
Architecture Overview: Diagrams and communication protocols (e.g., REST, gRPC).
Requirements & Error Handling: Concurrency, authentication details.
Constraints & Edge Cases: Legacy endpoint support, intermittent API failures.
Prompt Templates: Node.js code generation, Dockerfile creation.
Revision History: Tracks codebase and prompt updates.


Prompt Lifecycle Example:

Original: “Write a user login function in Java” (lacking context).
Revised: “Implement a Spring Boot user login with MFA, validate SQL injection, include tests.”
Outcome: Detailed code with test coverage, meeting project needs.



Four Core Prompting Strategies
These strategies enhance AI interactions for developers:

Q&A Strategy:

AI asks clarifying questions to understand requirements.
Example: “Create a Python file upload function; ask about file size, storage, and validation.”
Benefit: Reduces guesswork, ensures accurate solutions.


Pros & Cons Strategy:

Requests balanced comparisons of options (e.g., “Compare Redis vs. Memcached for Node.js caching”).
Benefit: Supports structured decision-making.


Stepwise (Chain-of-Thought) Strategy:

Solves tasks in discrete steps with user confirmation.
Example: “Refactor Node.js Express middleware step-by-step, pausing for review.”
Benefit: Maintains control, prevents compounding errors.


Role-Based Strategy:

AI acts as a specific expert (e.g., “senior database architect”).
Example: “Optimize PostgreSQL schema for an e-commerce platform.”
Benefit: Provides domain-specific insights.



Comprehensive AI Prompting Strategies & Techniques
This section unifies all prompting methods for maximum effect:

Zero-Shot Prompting:

Direct requests without examples (e.g., “Write a factorial function in Python”).
Pros: Quick. Cons: May lack detail.


Few-Shot Prompting:

Provides input-output examples to guide AI (e.g., sample code snippets for CSV reading).
Benefit: Ensures consistent style.


Q&A Prompting: AI clarifies requirements first (covered above).

Pros & Cons Prompting: Balanced option assessment (covered above).

Stepwise/Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Incremental solutions (covered above).

Role-Based Prompting: Expert persona guidance (covered above).

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

Uses external sources for context (e.g., “Propose a microservice architecture using our wiki”).
Benefit: Grounds responses in project-specific data.




Choosing the Right Approach:
Combine strategies for complex tasks.
Provide clear context and constraints.
Document successful prompts in the Project Doc.



Incorporating Function Templates (Developer Focus)
Function templates standardize code generation for consistency.

Why Use Templates?:

Ensures consistent signatures, docstrings, and return types.
Clarifies expectations for AI and developers.
Supports team collaboration.


Workflow:

Create/approve template with parameters and docstrings.
Submit to AI with constraints (e.g., “Handle 100k rows”).
Review AI-generated code for standards and security.
Refine iteratively.


Example Template:
def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    '''
    Authenticates a user.
    Parameters:
      username: User identifier
      password: User password
    Returns: bool - True if authenticated, else False
    '''
    pass


Prompt: “Implement logic using bcrypt and user database, handle missing username.”
Outcome: AI fills in secure logic, respecting the template.


Tips:

Use descriptive names and docstrings.
Outline edge cases (e.g., “Handle empty dataset”).
Avoid over-specifying implementation details.


Pitfalls:

Incomplete templates lead to missing logic.
Reusing templates without review can cause duplication.
Always verify AI code for security (e.g., SQL injection).



Tools & Tips: VS Code & Cursor
Enhance developer workflows with AI-integrated tools:

VS Code:

Install AI extensions (e.g., GitHub Copilot).
Use descriptive file names and docstrings for context.
Add inline comments (e.g., “# TODO: Optimize query”).
Test AI suggestions locally before production.


Cursor:

Highlight code for targeted refactoring.
Enable folder-aware context for multi-file insights.
Request explanations for debugging (e.g., “Why is this undefined?”).
Review large refactors incrementally.


General Tips:

Specify environment and constraints clearly.
Validate AI suggestions through code reviews.
Use iterative prompts for complex tasks.
Avoid exposing sensitive data in prompts.



Correct vs. Incorrect Prompt Examples
Prompt quality significantly impacts AI output.

Example 1: Code Generation (Python):

Incorrect: “Write code to sort data” (vague, lacks constraints).
Outcome: Generic snippet, no error handling.


Correct: “Write a Python function sort_records(records) to sort dictionaries by ‘timestamp.’ Return new list, skip null timestamps, include docstring.”
Outcome: Complete function with error handling.




Example 2: Debugging (Node.js):

Incorrect: “Why won’t my Node app work?” (too vague).
Outcome: Generic guesses.


Correct: “Node.js Express server returns ‘TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined’ in lines 45-60: [snippet]. Identify cause and suggest fixes.”
Outcome: Targeted diagnosis and solutions.




Example 3: Project Setup:

Incorrect: “Set up a microservice” (lacks specifics).
Outcome: Generic instructions.


Correct: “Create a Node.js microservice for authentication using Docker, JWT, and REST endpoints. Provide Dockerfile and package.json.”
Outcome: Specific, actionable setup.




Key Takeaways:

Provide specific data types, frameworks, and constraints.
Include code snippets or error logs for accuracy.
Balance detail without overwhelming the prompt.
Document successful prompts in the Project Doc.



Conclusion
Crafting effective AI prompts is an iterative process. By combining strategies like Q&A, Pros & Cons, Stepwise, and Role-Based prompting, and leveraging tools like VS Code and Cursor, developers can achieve consistent, high-quality results. Maintain a central Project Doc to streamline collaboration and reuse successful prompts. Always validate AI outputs for accuracy and security.
